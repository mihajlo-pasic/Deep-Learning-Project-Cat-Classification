# Deep Learning Project: Cat Image Classification

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on the classification of cat images. The objective was to develop and train a robust deep learning model capable of accurately identifying cat images from a diverse dataset.

## Project Overview

This project involved a comprehensive deep learning pipeline, starting from data acquisition and preprocessing through model development, training, and evaluation. The dataset, comprising images from various sources, presented challenges such as variations in file types, quality, and potential duplicates, which were addressed through thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning procedures. The core of the project involved designing and implementing a deep learning model, utilizing popular frameworks and libraries, to achieve high accuracy in cat image classification.

All detailed methodologies, code implementation, training processes, evaluation metrics, and results are thoroughly documented and can be reviewed in the `project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file. This notebook serves as the central hub for understanding the project's progression and findings.

## Academic Context

This project was undertaken as part of the "Artificial Intelligence" course at the Thomas More University of Applied Sciences, Geel, Belgium. It provided a practical opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of deep learning concepts to a real-world image classification problem, emphasizing data preparation, model architecture selection, and performance optimization.
